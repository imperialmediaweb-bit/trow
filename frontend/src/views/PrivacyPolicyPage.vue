      <section>
        <p>
          Throwbox AI ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
          collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our temporary email service, AI-powered
          email tools, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the
          collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

      <!-- Information We Collect -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Account Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When you create an account, we collect your email address and a hashed version of your password. We do not
          store passwords in plain text. If you sign up for a paid plan, payment processing is handled by our
          third-party payment processor, and we do not store your full credit card details on our servers.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Temporary Email Data</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Emails received by your temporary inboxes are stored on our servers for the duration of the inbox's
          retention period. This includes sender information, subject lines, email body content, and any attachments.
          Once the retention period expires, all associated email data is permanently and irreversibly deleted.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">AI Processing Data</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When you use our AI features (email summarization, phishing detection, smart categorization, or the
          writing assistant), the content of relevant emails is processed by our AI models. We do not use your
          email content to train our AI models. AI-generated summaries and analyses are stored only for the
          lifetime of the associated temporary inbox.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Usage Data</h3>
        <p>
          We automatically collect certain technical information when you access the Service, including your IP address,
          browser type, operating system, referring URLs, pages visited, and timestamps. This data is used to maintain
          service reliability, prevent abuse, and improve the user experience.
        </p>

      <!-- Data Retention -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">3. Data Retention</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Temporary email data is automatically deleted after the retention period configured for each inbox.
          Default retention periods vary by plan but typically range from 1 hour to 30 days. Once the retention
          period expires, all emails, attachments, and AI-generated analyses associated with that inbox are
          permanently deleted from our servers and cannot be recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Account information is retained for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account,
          we will remove your personal data within 30 days, except where we are required by law to retain certain
          records (e.g., billing records for tax compliance, which may be retained for up to 7 years).
